Quick start
============

.. important::
    **Changing the code for your robot might be the most important feature of the motion stack**, do not underestimate the power of yourself doing a better job than me who never saw your robot. The :ref:`api-label` section explains how to make your own package, launcher and node using the motion stack API.

What's this? A package? A workspace?
-------------------------------------

This repo is a whole workspace, this is not a package.
You can easily take out and use the package `src/motion_stack <https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack/blob/main/src/motion_stack>`_ and `src/motion_stack_msg <https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack/blob/main/src/motion_stack_msg>`_ for your own workspace.
I think providing a fully working workspace instead of a lonely package is easier to understand.

Executing
---------

``.bash`` files are provided to build, source and launch the moonbot_zero example. You can open the files and see what commands are running. Nothing complicated, it is the standrad ROS2 launch system.

``launch_stack.bash`` will build everything then execute the launcher for moonbot_zero.

.. code-block:: bash

    bash launch_stack.bash


**You will notice that nothing is running, warning you about missing data.**
This is because the Motion-Stack uses a data first approach, if data is missing it will warn you. This method avoids relying on the concept of nodes or participants that can be brittle.

If it's your first time launching, lvl1 is waiting for lvl0's data, which comes from the rviz simulation node (or you future robot). Once *simu_rviz* launched the Motion-Stack will receive data, start working and output what parts of it are ready.

.. code-block:: bash

    bash launch_simu_rviz.bash  # (separate terminal)

**You should see a robot!**

.. Note::
    ``launch_simu_rviz.bash`` launches rviz and a simulation node that imitates a motor's response. When using the real robot, you must not use this additional node (it will interfere with messages from the motors). You should launch rviz without simulation using ``launch_only_rviz.bash``

Parameters and Launchers
-------------------------

A customizable launching system is provided. It can be used (and modified) by your own packages.

.. Important::
    Tutorial explaining the launch API is provided in :ref:`api-label`.


- \ :py:data:`motion_stack.core.utils.static_executor.default_param` defines the default parameters. 
  - Parameter documentation is in this file.
  - Those can be ROS2 parameters if you are using ROS2. However, those are part of th "core", hence defined in pure python.
- Launch APIs and tools are in :py:mod:`motion_stack.api.launch`. Those are exposed to packages outside the motion stack.

  - \ :py:mod:`motion_stack.api.launch.builder.LevelBuilder` will generate your nodes (and launch description) depending on:

    - Your URDF.
    - The multiple end effectors.
    - Parameters to overwrite.

  - You can import these in your own package and launcher:
    ``from motion_stack.api.launch.builder import LevelBuilder``

- Sample launchers for specific robots and configurations are in `src/motion_stack/launch <https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack/blob/main/src/motion_stack/launch/>`_. These Python scripts are not exposed to other packages.

  - `src/motion_stack/launch/moonbot_zero.launch.py <https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack/blob/main/src/motion_stack/launch/moonbot_zero.launch.py>`_ is the launcher for moonbot_zero.

.. Note::
    You do not need to use the launch API, it is just a wrapper around the standard ROS2 launch system.
